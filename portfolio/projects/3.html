<h3>All Foods Mart</h3>

<h2>Project Requirements</h2>

<p>
    The All Foods Mart project required me to implement a new online experience for their customers. 
    Their requirements were for their website to be mobile-first, tablet-friendly, 
    and work great on desktop. The main features of their website is the coupon 
    clipping system, the different categories of produce to explore, and the Coupon 
    Club email list. Because it's a company's public website, SEO and Accessibility 
    are of upmost importance.
</p>

<p>
    To create this website, I was provided with a wireframe for mobile, tablet, and desktop. 
    Additionally, I was handed a branding guide and the content they wanted in the page. My 
    job was to implement it using HTML5 and CSS3. 
</p>

<p>
    I went section by section, starting from the header, writing the HTML5 and CSS3 to get 
    each section working on near-mobile (~450px) before moving to the next section. Once the 
    website looked how it needed to on near-mobile, I added the necessary code for it to move 
    to tablet and desktop interfaces. Then, I went back and added the color scheme from the 
    branding document. Once it was all looking good on Chrome, I tested it using mobile-device 
    Chrome & Safari, and desktop Chrome, Safari, & Firefox.
