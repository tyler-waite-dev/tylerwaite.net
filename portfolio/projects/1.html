<h3>In & Out Delivery Service</h3>

<h2>Project Requirements</h2>

<p>
    To develop this website, I initiated the process by crafting a mockup. Although I had a 
    clear understanding of my project requirements, the mockup was essential in providing a 
    concrete direction for my webpage.

<p>
    With the mockup as my guide, I proceeded to structure all the elements of my webpage using 
    HTML5. Once the foundational elements were in place, I leveraged the power of CSS3 to 
    infuse a polished and professional aesthetic, aligning with the design standards set by In & Out.
</p>

    Upon completing the visual design, I transitioned to the development of interactivity. JavaScript 
    played a pivotal role in enhancing user engagement and creating a dynamic experience for visitors 
    to the website.
